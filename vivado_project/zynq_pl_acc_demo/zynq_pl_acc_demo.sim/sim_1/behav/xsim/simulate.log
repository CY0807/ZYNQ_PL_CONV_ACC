WARNING: Behavioral models for independent clock FIFO configurations do not model synchronization delays. The behavioral models are functionally correct, and will represent the behavior of the configured FIFO. See the FIFO Generator User Guide for more information.
Block Memory Generator module tb_Conv_Acc.Conv_Acc_inst.bram_mac_inst.blk_mem_inst.inst.native_mem_module.blk_mem_gen_v8_4_3_inst is using a behavioral model for simulation which will not precisely model memory collision behavior.
